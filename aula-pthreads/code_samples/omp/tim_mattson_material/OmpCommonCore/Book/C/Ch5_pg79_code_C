The following pattern with a pair of OpenMP constructs, one to create the team of threads and the other to split up loop iterations among threads, is very common.
   #pragma omp parallel
   {
      #pragma omp for
         for-loop
   }
As a convenience, these two directives can be combined into a single directive.
   #pragma omp parallel for
      for-loop
