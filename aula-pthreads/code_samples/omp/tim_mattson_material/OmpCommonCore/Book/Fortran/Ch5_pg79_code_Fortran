The following pattern with a pair of OpenMP constructs, one to create the team of threads and the other to split up loop iterations among threads, is very common.
!$omp parallel 
   !$omp do
      do-loop
   !$omp end do
!$omp end parallel

As a convenience, these two directives can be combined into a single directive.
!$omp parallel do
    do-loop
!$omp end parallel do
