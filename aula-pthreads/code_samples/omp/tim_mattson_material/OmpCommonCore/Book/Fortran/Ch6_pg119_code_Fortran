define an array section in terms of the lower-bound, the upper-bound of the section, and the stride.
   (lower-bound:upper-bound:stride)
   (lower-bound:upper-bound)     ! stride implied as one
   (:upper-bound:stride)         ! lower-bound implied as one
Using an array section in the previous example, we can have each thread allocate and copy an original variable that is an array into a parallel region with the directive:
   !$omp parallel firstprivate(vptr(1:1000:1))
Array sections also work for the other clauses that create private copies of variables such as private and reduction.
