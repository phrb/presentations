C This program will numerically compute the integral of
C                   4/(1+x*x) 
C from 0 to 1.  The value of this integral is pi -- which 
C is great since it gives us an easy way to check the answer.

C The is the original sequential program.  It uses the timer
C from the OpenMP runtime library
