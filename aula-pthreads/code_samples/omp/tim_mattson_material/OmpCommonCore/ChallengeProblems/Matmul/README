This directory includes a test bed for working with matrix
multiplication algorithms.  Currently, we only cover the case
of dense matrices.

The program generates two different matrices with analytic answers.
One is with constant matrices.  This is easy to scale to any size
and easy to implement.  It's also too forgiving.

The progression matrix is a more complex matrix with nonconstant values.
Testing with a progression matrix is much more stringent.

For each case, the program runs multiple times and minimum, maximum and
average MFLOPS are reported.
